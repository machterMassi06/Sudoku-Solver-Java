= SudokuSolver

== Project Goal
Create a https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku[Sudoku] solver in Java using the backtracking method.

The program should:
- Read the puzzle from a `test.txt` file or from user input.
- Use a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
- Show the solution if it exists, or indicate that there is no solution.

== Requirements
- Java 11 or later
- Text file (example :`src/test.txt`) formatted in a 9x9 grid, where 0 represents an empty cell.

== How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    git https://github.com/machterMassi06/Sudoku-Solver-Java
    cd SudokuSolver
    ```

2. **Compile the Java files**:
    ```bash
    cd src
    javac SudokuSolver.java
    ```

3. **Run the program**:
    - To run with a file input:
      ```bash
      java SudokuSolver f test.txt
      ```
    - To run with user input:
      ```bash
      java SudokuSolver m
      ```
